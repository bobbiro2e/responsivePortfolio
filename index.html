      <p>Hey, my name is Bobbi Rose Lanser currently a student in Northwestern's Coding Bootcamp. I guess I'll start from the
        beginning. I spent my first eighteen years on a rural farm in Nebraska. People generally have a few follow-up questions
        after that statement so I'll go ahead and answer the FAQs. I lived twenty miles down gravel roads from the nearest
        town and sixty miles from the nearest city. "Town" includes the high-school, a gas station, and a population of 900
        people. "City" includes Wal-Mart, Target, and the lamest mall you've ever seen. Our farmland is about 5 square miles
        or 3,200 acres, and most of my family lives on our land. We grow corn and soybeans and raise pigs and cows. It is
        a humbling lifestyle, and I wouldn't change my upbringing for the world.
      </p>
      <p>But, I knew since age nine my future lied beyond that 5 miles. At eighteen I packed up my things and moved to, the
        big city, as they call it on the farm. Chicago is my adopted home and I love it with all my heart. I truly believe
        it is the most beautiful city in the world. Right now I live on the northside in Lakeview-East. Just before beginning
        camp I was bartending and serving at a couple bars in Wrigleyville, including Cubby Bear and Sluggers. It was an
        interesting career, to say the least. Still, it's those same degrading experiences that are the sole reason I decided
        to transform my predicted dim fate and join this program. Now, I absolutely know I am doing exactly what I need to
        do for an incredibly bright future.</p>
