            <p>Hey, my name is Bobbi Rose Lanser currently a student in Northwestern's Coding Bootcamp. I guess I'll start from
                the beginning. I spent my first eighteen years on a rural farm in Nebraska. People generally have a few follow-up
                questions after that statement so I'll go ahead and answer the FAQs. I lived twenty miles down gravel roads
                from the nearest town and sixty miles from the nearest city. "Town" includes the high-school, a gas station,
                and a population of 900 people. "City" includes Wal-Mart, Target, and the lamest mall you've ever seen. Our
                farmland is about 5 square miles or 3,200 acres, and most of my family lives on our land. We grow corn and
                soybeans and raise pigs and cows. It is a humbling lifestyle, and I wouldn't change my upbringing for the
                world.
            </p>
            <p>But, I knew since age nine my future lied beyond that 5 miles. At eighteen I packed up my things and moved to,
                the big city, as they call it on the farm. Chicago is my adopted home and I love it with all my heart. I
                truly believe it is the most beautiful city in the world. Right now I live on the northside in Lakeview-East.
                Just before beginning camp I was bartending and serving at a couple bars in Wrigleyville, including Cubby
                Bear and Sluggers. It was an interesting career, to say the least. Still, it's those same degrading experiences
                that are the sole reason I decided to transform my predicted dim fate and join this program. Now, I absolutely
                know I am doing exactly what I need to do for an incredibly bright future.</p>
